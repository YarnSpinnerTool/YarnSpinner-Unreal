    A: Right? #line:test1_4

<<declare $explainCount = 1>>

Ok, listen up because I'm only going to say this {$explainCount} {$explainCount}|plural(one=time,other=times): you can use *variables* in your Yarn scripts! #line:test1_9
-> Sorry, could you please repeat that? #line:test1_10
    // Had to add the following line because the current runner needs the user to press "Continue" for *every* line, including commands.
    Ughh... fine. #line:test1_11
    <<set $explainCount = $explainCount + 1>>
    <<jump Variables>>
-> Got it! #line:test1_12
    Good! #line:test1_13

So what about expressions, then?  Can we do maths?  Like 3.2 + 6.7 + 18 = {3.2 + 6.7 + 18}?  #line:test1_14
Ok, and can we do expressions with variables? I explained variables to you {$explainCount} times, but it felt like {$explainCount * 1000} times!  So let's just say 'yes' for now and leave it at that. #line:test1_15

Let's call a function now.  MyAwesomeFunc returns: {MyAwesomeFunc(true, 12.345)} #line:test1_16
Nice!  Let's call another.  DoStuff returns: {DoStuff(true, 12.345, "a string")} #line:test1_17
Last time, using standard YarnSpinner functions this time. 123 + 456 - 789 is {123 + 456 - 789}! #line:test1_18
Ok, that's enough functions for now. Let's move on. #line:test1_19
